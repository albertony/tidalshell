# TidalShell

Unofficial PowerShell wrapper of the [Tidal](https://tidal.com/) REST API.
The main objective for now is to have a test bench for exploring the features
of the API, not an extremely robust and efficient interface.

See also [blushell](https://github.com/albertony/blushell),
PowerShell wrapper for the API of the BluOS music management system.
